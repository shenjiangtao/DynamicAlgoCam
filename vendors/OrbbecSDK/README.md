### 1.1 Migration from Orbbec SDK v1 to Open-Source Orbbec SDK v2
To enhance performance and meet the diverse needs of our customers, the Orbbec SDK has been open-sourced since version 2.0.0.

#### Upgrade Recommendation

For projects currently utilizing version Orbbec SDK v1.x that are considering an upgrade to Orbbec SDK v2.x, we advise using the pre-compiled binaries available in the [Release](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases) page. This ensures a seamless transition and maintains consistency with your existing setup.

#### API Compatibility
We have made every effort to maintain backward compatibility with the previous API. However, in pursuit of higher performance and an improved user experience, several updates have been introduced. Some interfaces were modified or removed due to infrequent use or design limitations. These adjustments were made carefully to minimize disruption and do not affect the SDK’s standard functionality.

#### Migration Resources

- Migration guidance: [orbbecsdkv1_to_openorbbecsdkv2.md](docs/tutorial/orbbecsdkv1_to_openorbbecsdkv2.md)
- Comprehensive API Changes Overview: [api_changes_at_v2.x.x.md](docs/api/api_changes_at_v2.x.x.md)

#### Continued using for Orbbec SDK v1.x

If you wish to continue using Orbbec SDK v1.x, the pre-compiled binaries remain available in our [OrbbecSDK v1](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK) repository.
Nonetheless, we strongly encourage migration to Orbbec SDK v2.x, which offers enhanced features, better performance, and ongoing support.
Our commitment to SDK v2.x reflects Orbbec’s long-term strategy to provide robust support, foster an open-source community, and drive continuous innovation.

### 1.2 Upgrading from OpenNI Protocol to UVC Protocol

#### Timeline and Scope
Starting from October 2025 (Orbbec SDK v2.5.5), we will begin upgrading devices that use the OpenNI protocol to the UVC protocol, enabling full compatibility with Orbbec SDK v2.

Already upgraded devices and future upgrade schedule：

| **Already Upgraded Devices** | **Future Upgrade Schedule** |
|---|---|
| • Astra Mini S Pro<br>• Astra Mini Pro | • Gemini E, Gemini UW, Gemini EW<br>• DaBai Max, DaBai Max Pro<br>• DaBai DW, DaBai DCW, DaBai DCW2, DaBai DW2 |

#### OpenNI-to-UVC Firmware Upgrade Tool
Orbbec provides a dedicated [firmware upgrade tool](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecFirmware) that enables devices to switch from the OpenNI protocol to the UVC protocol.
Please select the firmware download link for your device type and follow the corresponding upgrade guide to update the firmware.


#### Upgrade Instructions
If you are currently using the OpenNI SDK, please refer to the [How to Upgrade OpenNI Protocol Devices to UVC Protocol and API Usage Guide](docs/tutorial/opennisdk_to_orbbecsdkv2.md) for detailed instructions on switching to Orbbec SDK v2 after updating your device firmware.
After upgrading to the UVC protocol, these devices will have a firmware major version number of 2 (for example: v2.x.xx).


#### Important Notes
- Firmware version v2.x.x (major version 2) indicates a UVC protocol device, which requires Orbbec SDK v2.
- Firmware version v1.x.x (major version 1) indicates an OpenNI protocol device, which requires either the OpenNI SDK or Orbbec SDK v1.

## 2. Documentation

*The Orbbec SDK documentation is available on [GitHub Pages](https://orbbec.github.io/OrbbecSDK_v2/).*

### 2.1 Environment Setup

#### windows

For windows, you need to register the metadata associated with frames (this includes things like timestamps and other information about the video frame).

- Metadata registration follow this:[/scripts/env_setup/obsensor_metadata_win10.md](scripts/env_setup/obsensor_metadata_win10.md)

*Notes: If the metadata is not registered, the device timestamp will be abnormal, thereby affecting the SDK’s internal frame synchronization functionality.*

#### Linux

For Linux, we have provided a script to help you set up the environment. You can run the script as follows:

```bash
cd scripts/env_setup
  sudo chmod +x ./install_udev_rules.sh
  sudo ./install_udev_rules.sh
  sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger
```

*Notes: If this script is not executed, open the device will fail due to permission issues. You need to run the sample with sudo (administrator privileges).*

### 3.1 The QuickStart Example

```c++
// Create a pipeline.
ob::Pipeline pipe;

// Start the pipeline with default config.
pipe.start();

// Create a window for showing the frames, and set the size of the window.
ob_smpl::CVWindow win("QuickStart", 1280, 720, ob_smpl::ARRANGE_ONE_ROW);

while(win.run()) {
    // Wait for frameSet from the pipeline, the default timeout is 1000ms.
    auto frameSet = pipe.waitForFrameset();

    // Push the frames to the window for showing.
    win.pushFramesToView(frameSet);
}

// Stop the Pipeline, no frame data will be generated
pipe.stop();
```
